# Alzheimers Diagnosis Prediction

By Alekhya Vittalam, Kirpa Kaur, Guantong Zhang, and Bingcheng Wang

### **Problem Statement**

This project explores two key questions:

1. Can an optimized predictive model accurately diagnose Alzheimer’s disease? \
Our goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a predictive model capable of accurately diagnosing Alzheimer’s based on predictors such as demographics, lifestyle factors, medical history, and cognitive assessments. This tool aims to assist healthcare professionals in evaluating the likelihood of Alzheimer’s early in its progression.
2. Can correlations between patient attributes and diagnostic outcomes inform recommendations for tests? \
We analyzed relationships between demographic, lifestyle, medical, and cognitive measurements and assessments to identify meaningful patterns. Insights from these correlations could guide diagnostic test prioritization based on patient profiles.

**Background**

Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder and a leading cause of disability in the elderly. Early diagnosis is crucial for timely intervention and a better quality of life. However, its complexity—requiring clinical, imaging, and laboratory assessments—makes diagnosis challenging. Machine learning offers a promising solution by analyzing multidimensional datasets to uncover patterns traditional methods might miss, enabling earlier and more accurate detection.
